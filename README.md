### This is
A work-in-progress repo, intended for prototyping engine and graphics features. A spiritual successor of another project I worked on (https://github.com/norrischiu/DEngine).

### To Run
Use Sample/build.bat to generate solution at Sample/Build/, Visual Studio 2017 is required. 

Make sure you have configured Win10 sdk path correctly, because the shaders are built using custom build command with dxc.exe from Visual Studio.

### It Has
- Lock-free job system
- Framegraph (WIP)
- Handle-based pool allocator and container
- SIMD maths
